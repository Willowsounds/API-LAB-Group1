**What the example does**

Example 1 uses [Annyang] to call 2 different text outputs on screen as a response to voice commands. It is an introductionary example for exploring other examples. 
  
This is done through using DOM to access HTML ellements and defining functions to be called on them as the voice command is recognised.
