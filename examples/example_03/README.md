**What the example does**

Example 3 uses [Annyang] to let users change the display of text content on a screen. This example allows to use one's voice to:

  - Increase font size
  - Scroll down
  - Make text uppercase 
  
This is done through using DOM to access HTML ellements and defining functions to be called on them as the voice command is recognised.
