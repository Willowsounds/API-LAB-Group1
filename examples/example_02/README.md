**What the example does**

Example 2 uses [Annyang] to control an embedded video on a website. This example allows to use one's voice to:

  - pause the video
  - and restart the video when needed
 
  
This is done through using DOM to access HTML ellements and defining functions to be called on them as the voice command is recognised.

  -the video is embedded in HTML with the <video> hmtl5 tag and then called through the dom
  -two functions are declared within the JavaScript file that pause and play the video
  -with the commands the words that needed to be recognized by annyang are defined.
