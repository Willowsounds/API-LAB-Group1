**What the example does**

Example 6 uses [Annyang] to call a function that makes an alert window appear with a text "Welcome!". It is a basic example of using Annyang and is not used during presentation.

This is done through using DOM to access HTML ellements and defining functions to be called on them as the voice command is recognised.
